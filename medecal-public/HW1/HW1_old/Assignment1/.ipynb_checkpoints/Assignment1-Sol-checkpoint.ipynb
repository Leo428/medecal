    "## Here is some background on the Flu\n",
    "Influenza viruses are enveloped, single-stranded, segmented negative-sense RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza A and B have 8 genome segments encoding major structural and nonstructural proteins, with major antigenic recognition sites within the two spike proteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Influenza replication in the host cell occurs by means of a viral encoded polymerase that lacks proof-reading capability, leading to frequent point mutations. Accumulation of these point mutations within the antigenic recognition sites of HA and NA can result in host immune evasion, thereby causing annual seasonal epidemics. Current estimates suggest that seasonal influenza A and B cause 4-5 million severe infections in humans with approximately 291,000 to 645,000 deaths per year globally. Whilst influenza B remains largely a human pathogen, influenza type A is a zoonotic virus infecting a\n",
    "wide range of avian and other non-human species. To date 18 haemagglutinin and 11 neuraminidase types have been recognised, with a reservoir for the majority within birds. These viruses have the\n",
    "capability to reassort leading to the emergence of new strain. Should these include new HA and NA proteins, pandemic viruses can emerge that completely evade the host response leading to global epidemics of often high morbidity and mortality in both non-human and human hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here is some background on past methods.\n",
    "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been used to study the influenza virus genome for over a decade, and is as an important tool in research. Two important data  resources exist to this end; the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource (NIVR), and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), wherein over a hundred thousand influenza genome segment sequences can be found from isolates sequenced across the globe. Bioinformatics pipelines have begun to be developed for efficient processing of this data. Despite the increasing application of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to influenza, the pitfalls associated with current mapping approaches have not been explored in depth. Due to diversity of influenza genome sequences, past methods routinely result in a large number of unmapped reads. In turn, this can potentially result in data loss and bias in sequences that are subsequently recovered, analyzed, and submitted to public databases. This has been previously noted in study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Whilst alternatives, such as read classification by mapping to a large database of influenza sequences and subsequent processes can help to resolve this issue, such pipelines are often complex, slow, and require expertise that is not necessarily available in routine surveillance. Secondly, even if bioinformatics pipelines are chosen carefully, sequences of\n",
    "zoonotic (animals) origin may fail to be identified, resulting in a dataset that appears to be low coverage, missing segments, or missing potential future pandemic reassortments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here is the goal of the assignment\n",
    "We aim to show that this problem can be resolved by classification of isolates from reads of genetic data prior to WGS/NGS analysis by directly querying a De Bruijn graph (DBG). To further develop a simple method for querying short influenza genome sequences, we leverage the large number of publicly available influenza segment sequences, creating this VAPOR classifier."

    "Now that the model is finished we must train and test it. Since genetic sequences are unique and De Bruijin relies on mapping, each case of test/train is different from the traditional model. Usually, a large dataset would be split and the model would be saved after training on some unique subset of that dataset and be tested on a different unique subset as validation. Instead, since the results of two different approaches, BLAST and MASH, as well as the VAPOR classifier itself are known and bounded, you just have to replicate the results of the VAPOR classifier (e.g. if your code was right you're done). What makes this so amazing is that the VAPOR classifier does not require any preprocessing, it is the same as taking a swab of DNA, digitally encoding it, and putting it into a classifier. In comparison BLAST and MASH both require pre-processing and don't deal with mutations nor physical imperfections of collections that well, so they must be analyzed and \"fixed\" (both use other algorithms to reformat mutated DNA, based of a likeliness of relation to close genetic strings, an application of genetic phylogenesis/homology).
